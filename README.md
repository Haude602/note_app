# note_app

Note app is a simple app to make notes, it uses CRUD operations of DBMS using SQLite and SQFlite. The notes are stored in local database inside the mobile.
I also added firebase authentication in another version which is in '1) authentication' branch.

Please clone different branches for different version of this app. Every new branch is added with some more updates.
